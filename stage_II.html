                        Next, answer the following questions to find the most suitable LLM for your use case. If an answer has an LLM followed by an `(*)' sign, this indicates that papers reported (not necessarily the same papers) that the LLM was the best performing LLM in the selected condition. e.g. there may be three different papers reporting the same LLM as the best performing model in three different clinical tasks, so when `Yes' is selected for all three clinical tasks, the answer will have the name of that LLM followed by the `(*)'. Those without the `(*)' are simply LLMs that satisfy the selected condition.<br>
                        <span style="color: blue;">Blue text</span> that appears in a question indicates that a specific explanation is available by clicking on that text. The explanation will appear at the bottom of the page and can be closed by clicking red `close' in the explanation.<br>
