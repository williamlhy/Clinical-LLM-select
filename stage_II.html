                        Next, answer the following questions to find the most suitable LLM for your use case. If an answer has an LLM followed by an `(*)' sign, this indicates that papers reported (not necessarily the same papers) that the LLM was the best performing LLM in the selected condition. e.g. there may be three different papers reporting the same LLM as the best performing model in three different clinical tasks, so when `Yes' is selected for all three clinical tasks, the answer will have the name of that LLM followed by the `(*)'. Those without the `(*)' are simply LLMs that satisfy the selected condition.<br>

Tabular data can also be used as textual data after being converted into textual form, such as a patient's laboratory indicators. However, data such as medical images, electrocardiograms, etc. are not textual data.",
        "generate text related to radiology": "It refers to the ability to perform at least one similar task, such as generating precautions for radiology examination, generating the finding portion of a radiology report, converting free text into a standardized radiology report, radiology report error checking, radiology report simplification, etc.",

        "locally":"It refers to the way the LLMs is deployed and run in the local environment. It allows for better control and management of model operations, protects the privacy and security of patient data, and reduces reliance on external networks. Local environment refers to a specific computing environment that is operated and developed on a personal computer or specific device. It can be a server, desktop computer, laptop or mobile device within a healthcare organization, etc.",
        "in the cloud":"It refers to the deployment of LLMs in a cloud computing environment. Cloud computing is based on network providing computing resources and services through remote servers.  By deploying LLMs in the cloud, medical professionals can take full advantage of the high-performance computing resources provided by cloud computing. Training, reasoning, and management of models in the cloud can greatly reduce the burden on local devices and can flexibly adjust the scale of computing resources according to demand. Cloud computing also provides advanced data security and privacy protections that can ensure the safety and reliability of medical data. Accessing commercial LLMs like ChatGPT through an api or website also falls under the category of cloud deployment, but data privacy and security are not guaranteed.",
