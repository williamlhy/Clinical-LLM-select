Welcome to the [Clinical LLM Selection Tool](https://williamlhy.github.io/Clinical-LLM-select/)! 
 
We present the **Clinical LLM Selector**, an interactive online guideline designed to assist healthcare practitioners in identifying the most suitable large language model (LLM) for their specific needs. The Selector provides **evidence-based guidance** by leveraging insights from **270 peer-reviewed studies** that apply or develop LLMs in healthcare.

The manuscript for our paper, *Implementing Large Language Models in Health Care: Clinician-Focused Review With Interactive Guideline*, is available [here](https://www.jmir.org/2025/1/e71916).

### Structure of the Clinical LLM Selector
- [Introduction](https://williamlhy.github.io/Clinical-LLM-select/intro.html)
- [Guideline](https://williamlhy.github.io/Clinical-LLM-select/guideline.html)
- [Stage I](https://williamlhy.github.io/Clinical-LLM-select/stage_I.html) 
- [Stage II](https://williamlhy.github.io/Clinical-LLM-select/stage_II.html)  
- [Stage III](https://williamlhy.github.io/Clinical-LLM-select/stage_III.html)  
- [Stage IV](https://williamlhy.github.io/Clinical-LLM-select/stage_IV.html) 
- [Stage V](https://williamlhy.github.io/Clinical-LLM-select/stage_V.html) 

To use the tool, users need to answer a series of questions that should lead to the identification of a suitable solution.
