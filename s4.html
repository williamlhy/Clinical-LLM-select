        Next, answer the following questions to find the most suitable LLM for your use case. If an answer has an LLM followed by an `(*)' sign, this indicates that papers reported (not necessarily the same papers) that the LLM was the best performing LLM in the selected condition. e.g. there may be three different papers reporting the same LLM as the best performing model in three different clinical tasks, so when `Yes' is selected for all three clinical tasks, the answer will have the name of that LLM followed by the `(*)'. Those without the `(*)' are simply LLMs that satisfy the selected condition.<br>
        Blue text that appears in a question indicates that a specific explanation is available by clicking on that text. The explanation will appear at the bottom of the page and can be closed by clicking red `close' in the explanation.<br>
        Any links (gray text) present in the answer can be accessed by clicking on them.

                "in the cloud":"It refers to the deployment of LLMs in a cloud computing environment. Cloud computing is based on network providing computing resources and services through remote servers.  By deploying LLMs in the cloud, medical professionals can take full advantage of the high-performance computing resources provided by cloud computing. Training, reasoning, and management of models in the cloud can greatly reduce the burden on local devices and can flexibly adjust the scale of computing resources according to demand. Cloud computing also provides advanced data security and privacy protections that can ensure the safety and reliability of medical data. Accessing commercial LLMs like ChatGPT through an api or website also falls under the category of cloud deployment, but data privacy and security are not guaranteed.",
                "extract information from clinical text":"It refers to the ability to perform at least one similar task, such as extracting ICD codes from clinical records, clinical named entity recognition, etc.",
                "answer medical questions":"medical questions includes multiple-choice and open-ended questions (and may also include visual questions, i.e., where there are medical images in the input) on tasks related to treatment and hospitalization. Open questions are questions that require a free-form text answer. These questions usually require more in-depth thinking and personalized answers rather than choosing from a limited number of options. These questions may relate to treatment options, surgical risks, medication choices, rehabilitation programs, and more.",
                "summarize clinical records":"includes summarizing the conversation between the doctor and the patient, summarizing the medical questions asked by the patient, etc."
