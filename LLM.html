<h1>Brief introduction</h1>
<p align="left">We collected and recorded basic information about 203 large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain and their fulfillment of various clinical tasks. By considering a five-stage clinical workflow, we provide some recommendations for the clinical integration of LLMs. Emphasis is placed on our development of a clinical LLMs selection tool, which is designed to provide evidence-based guidance to medical practitioners in identifying the LLMs that are best suited to their specific needs.</p>
<h2>Five-stage clinical workflow</h2>
<p>We considered a patient-oriented clinical workflow, with numbers I-v representing various stages where LLMs may be applied. Tasks of LLMs are represented by colored discs.</p>

<h2>Clinical LLM Selection Tool</h2>
<div class="instruction">
    Welcome to the Clinical LLM Selection Tool! This tool will help a wide range of medical practitioners identify the medical LLM that is best suited to your specific needs. By answering a few questions, we will provide you with tailored LLM advice and the resources you need to get started. All of the information provided is derived from our review paper: Implementing Large Language Models in Healthcare: A Clinician's Review.
</div>
<div class="instruction">
    Currently our clinical LLMs selection tool is only open for Stages II-V. From the review we authored, we found that there was only one clinical application of LLMs for Stage I, so we were unable to create a similar tool for Stage I.<br>

Next, click on the button corresponding to the stage of the clinical workflow where the task you need to complete is located. Stage II is pre-diagnosis and examination, stage III is diagnosis and treatment planning, stage IV is treatment and hospitalization and stage V is discharge and follow-up.
