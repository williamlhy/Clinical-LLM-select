Welcome to the Clinical LLM Selection Tool! 

This tool aims at providing evidence-based guidance for medical practitioners in the identification of large language models (LLMs) that best suit their specific needs. 
The Clinical LLM Selection Tool algorithm uses information based on a review of 203 peer-reviewed papers that used or developed LLMs in healthcare (manuscript in progress).

To use the tool, users need to answer a series of questions that should lead to the identification of a suitable solution.
