            <h3>Review of medical LLMs</h3>
            <p align="left">We have collected and documented 203 large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain to accomplish various types of clinical tasks and basic information about the LLMs. By considering a five-stage clinical workflow, we provide some recommendations for the clinical integration of LLMs. Emphasis is placed on our development of a clinical LLMs selection tool, which is designed to provide evidence-based guidance to medical practitioners in identifying the LLMs that are best suited to their specific needs.</p>
